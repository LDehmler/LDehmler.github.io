                    Bicycling Monterey provides resources and inspiration for 
                    people who bike anywhere and serves as an Information Hub 
                    for Biking Monterey County. A grassroots volunteer effort 
                    founded 2009, Bicycling Monterey is local partner of the 
                    California Bicycle Coalition. Below is an overview about 
                    the Bicycling Monterey site and projects, and a sampling 
                    of our photos of visitors and residents biking in 
                    Monterey County.

                    See what people say about the Bicycling Monterey work. 
                    Bicycling Monterey is renowned for accurate, reliable 
                    information. This website features over 700 web pages of 
                    original content, including thousands of original photos. 
                    Bicycling Monterey includes numerous bike advocacy projects. 
                    <br><br>
                    Why we do what we do: Bicycling helps reduce the environmental 
                    impact of transportation, including carbon emissions. 
                    Bicycling improves public health, strengthens communities, 
                    and has multiple other benefits. Besides, biking is fun!

                    Bicycling Monterey is a local partner of the 
                    California Bicycle Coalition and collaborates on local, 
                    regional, state, national, and international bicycling advocacy efforts.
                    <br><br>
                    As of the start of 2023, there is not yet an official bicycling 
                    coalition for Monterey County, or for the Monterey Bay Tri-County Region. 
                    Bicycling Monterey helps fill that gap, including with its 35-section 
                    directory of Monterey County Bicycling Resources / Bike Community Leaders.

                    How else does a place become more welcoming for people who bike?

                    Valued by a wide mix of people, Bicycling Monterey is a trusted resource 
                    linked by local, regional, state, and national organizations, e.g., the 
                    Transportation Agency for Monterey County,  Cruz511 – Santa Cruz County 
                    Regional Transportation Commission, University of California at Berkeley’s 
                    CATSIP, League of American Bicyclists, People for Bikes, and many others.

                    Since founded in 2009, the work of the founder on this website and on 
                    all Bicycling Monterey projects has been done as an unpaid volunteer. 
                    That’s still the case at the start of 2023.

                    As reported by Kera Abraham in “The Change Agent” in the Monterey County 
                    Weekly’s first special bike issue in 2011: “What started as [the founder, 
                    Mari’s] personal blog two years ago quickly evolved into an umbrella website 
                    for all things two-wheeled in Monterey County.”
